My research interests
======
My research interests focus on journalism with a particular emphasis on citizen journalism, computer-mediated communication, and political communication. My research projects have often been comparative and have used both qualitative and quantitative methods.

My work has been presented at international conferences, including ICA and IAMCR, and has won the Top Paper Award and Top Poster Award from the International Communication Association. Additionally, my research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as Journalism Practice and the Chinese Journal of Communication.
