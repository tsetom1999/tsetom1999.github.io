I am a Mphil student at the School of Journalism and Communication, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My research interests
======
My research interests focus on journalism with a particular emphasis on citizen journalism, computer-mediated communication, and political communication. I have published my papers in journals such as Journalism Practice, and Chinese Journal of Communication.

To date, most of my research projects have focused on citizen journalism. In addition, I have conducted research in the areas of political communication, and new media. My research projects have employed both qualitative and quantitative methods and are often comparative in nature.
