I am a Mphil student at the School of Journalism and Communication, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My research interests
======
My research interests focus on journalism with a particular emphasis on citizen journalism, computer-mediated communication, and political communication. My research projects have often been comparative and have used both qualitative and quantitative methods.

My research has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as Journalism Practice, and Chinese Journal of Communication. My work has been presented at numerous international conferences, including ICA, and IAMCR.
