* E2JOU001C Journalism Course (Level II): Introduction to Citizen Journalism
  * This course is designed to prepare secondary students in Hong Kong to work as local citizen journalists in the context of emerging personalised media. In the age of digital communication, personalized media devices have empowered citizens to be actively engaged in public affairs in their everyday life. On a daily basis, hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in have turned to social network platforms, to express their views or report on various issues in an unprecedented scale and intensity. The interplay between citizen participation in public affairs and journalism in Hong Kong and Greater China is particularly acute, given the increasing controversies in issues such as public 2 transportation, urban development, public health, and elections in recent years. It is therefore theoretically critical and practically important that students become aware of such journalistic practices and their impact on the structure and processes of social activism, political involvement and public life in general and in Hong Kong in particular.
